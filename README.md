## Usage

Using Portal is straightforward. Here's a simple example to illustrate its capabilities:

### Basic Transition Example

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Portal

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showDetail = false

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                Button("Show Detail") {
                    withAnimation {
                        showDetail.toggle()
                    }
                }
                .navigate(to: DetailView(), when: $showDetail)
            }
        }
    }
}

struct DetailView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Detail View")
            .navigationBarTitle("Detail", displayMode: .inline)
    }
}
```

This code demonstrates a basic button that triggers a transition to a detail view. You can customize the animation and transition effects to match your design.

## Examples

Here are some examples showcasing the capabilities of Portal:

### 1. Sheet Transition

You can easily present sheets with smooth transitions. Hereâ€™s how:

```swift
struct MainView: View {
    @State private var showSheet = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Present Sheet") {
            showSheet.toggle()
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showSheet) {
            SheetView()
        }
    }
}

struct SheetView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("This is a sheet!")
    }
}
```

### 2. Navigation Push

For navigation, you can use Portal to push new views seamlessly:

```swift
struct NavigationViewExample: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationLink(destination: NextView()) {
            Text("Go to Next View")
        }
    }
}

struct NextView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Welcome to the Next View")
    }
}
```
